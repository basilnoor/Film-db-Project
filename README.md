  I created a simple web application as a means to practice various database concepts and to improve my skills with SQL queries and MySQL. In creating the application, I   aimed to utilize as many concepts as possible while maintaining a consistent and normalized schema for the database, which would be easily scalable and maintainable.     The setup for the queries used in the application can be found in the 'queries' folder, with DDL.sql containing the data definition queries and DML.sql containing the   data manipulation queries.

  Sadly I haven't hosted the project so instead I'll cover the relationships as well any query options per page below.
